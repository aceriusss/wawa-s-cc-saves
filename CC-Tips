'Tips'


Ascension-
You shouldn’t ascend as soon as the option appears. You will completely restart your game with only a minor upgrade.
100 to 200 prestige levels are considered a quick and early ascension. At that point, you’ll have enough heavenly chips to choose a few different upgrades.
Many experts wait until you have 2337 prestige levels to ascend the first time
People who first prestige at 2337 take their subsequent ascension at 115,307, and the third at 2,189,163. 
They follow the 2019 ascensions guide by Finkus and purchase the upgrades that he recommends.

1.Look for a list of heavenly upgrades. There are many of them, and you can find them on Wikis for the game o2r video guides.
2.Read through the options to determine what each upgrade provides.
3.Write down the cost of each upgrade in heavenly chips. Keep a running total as you choose the ones you want the most.
4.Look for upgrades that will give a considerable boost to your CPS at the beginning of a new run. These help you asend quicker
5.If you need five upgrades that cost 150 heavenly chips, then you know you need to wait for 150 levels before you ascend.
